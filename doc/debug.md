Debug-mode
==========

gitlib offers a debug mode, to make you see edge-cases of your usage.
This is called debug-mode.

Debug-mode is enabled by default. If you disable it, gitlib will behave
differently:

-   when an error is met during execution, gitlib will try to minimize
    it, to not block execution flow. Errors will still be reporter in
    logger.
-   logs will be more verbose. They will contain every output, every
    return code, every possible information to ease debugging.

If you want to disable exceptions and try to minimize as much as
possible errors, pass `false` when construction a repository:

```php
$repository = new Gitonomy\Git\Repository($path'/tmp/repo', $debug = false)
```

`$debug` argument should be available in every method you can use to
create a repository.
