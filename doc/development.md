Developing gitlib
=================

If you plan to contribute to gitlib, here are few things you should
know:

Documentation generation
------------------------

Documentation is generated using Sphinx (restructured text).
Configuration file is located in
<https://github.com/gitonomy/website/blob/master/bin/conf.py>

You will need to fetch vendor modules for PHP blocks especially. If you
really want to generate it, install the website project locally and hack
into it.

Test against different git versions
-----------------------------------

A script `test-git-version.sh` is available in repository to test gitlib
against many git versions.

This script is not usable on Travis-CI, they would hate me for this. It
creates a local cache to avoid fetching from Github and compiling if
already compiled.

Use it at your own risk, it's still under experiment.
