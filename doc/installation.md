Installation of gitlib
======================

Autoloading
-----------

gitlib relies on class autoloading. It does not require any additional setup.

Using composer
--------------

You can install gitlib using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Simply
require the version you need:

```bash
$ composer require gitonomy/gitlib
```

or edit your `composer.json` file by hand:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "gitonomy/gitlib": "^1.2"
    }
}
```
