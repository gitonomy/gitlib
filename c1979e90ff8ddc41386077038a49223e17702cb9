Also I think this would fix #120 (as this PR removes the ProcessBuilder)...

Kind of assumed it would've been the same treatment as [this comment](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp/pull/428#issuecomment-354109029)?
But seeing there is no `--prefer-lowest` here.

What do you suggest, @keradus? Because I don't really have any experience w/ Travis, to be honest... :-/

currently, only v2 and v3 is used, v4 is not picked, let me check

> v4 is not picked

If you're referring to the previous Travis build results:
at that time, `symfony/*` was still in `4.0-beta`...?

no, I'm refering to current build.
v4 is not used because of it requires 7.1+, which is not configured.
It will be pickuped in this PR as soon as #124 will be merge.
